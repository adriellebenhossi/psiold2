# Adrielle Benhossi Psychology Website

## Overview
This project is a sophisticated, full-stack web application for Dr. Adrielle Benhossi, a psychologist, featuring a comprehensive admin dashboard and advanced content management system. The platform serves as a complete digital ecosystem for professional psychology practice, including patient testimonials, academic articles, service management, contact scheduling, marketing analytics, and advanced SEO optimization. The business vision encompasses professional credibility, client engagement, content publication, and robust digital marketing capabilities with tracking and analytics.

## User Preferences
**Communication Style:** Simple, everyday language.
**Code Documentation:** Comprehensive Portuguese comments explaining every line and functionality.
**Avatar Requirements:** Specific, differentiated designs matching testimonial descriptions.
**Admin Workflow:** Manual actions only - user-triggered actions (clicks, drags) should save immediately without automatic background updates or delays.
**Interface Behavior:** No automatic cache refreshes that cause "piscadas" or interface flickering during editing.
**Button Standardization:** All admin panel buttons use unified `btn-admin` CSS class with #0a0a0a background and white text for consistent design across 20+ components.
**Database Indexing:** System uses enableGoogleIndexing toggle in marketing_pixels configuration to control search engine visibility.
**SEO Implementation:** Dynamic robots meta tags and robots.txt generation based on admin panel settings.
**Mobile Optimization:** Drag-and-drop system disabled on mobile devices - only arrow buttons for reordering. Mobile uses touch-optimized interface with larger buttons and simplified controls.
**Button Responsiveness:** All "Salvar textos" buttons in admin forms are now fully responsive and centered on mobile devices with consistent styling.
